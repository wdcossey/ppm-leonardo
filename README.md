# ppm-leonardo
Decodes PPM data directly to an Arduino Leonardo USB Game Controller.

This sketch requires nothing other than:
1. PPM compatible RC receiver.
2. Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro (ATmega32u4 microcontroller).


There's **no** need for any software or virtual joysticks as it's all controlled by the microcontroller.
